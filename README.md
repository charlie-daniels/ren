# Bulk renamer

## Overview

This is a command line python program to rename a directory of files and allows different parameters to be set.

This project makes use of the native *glob* and *os* modules to interface with the system. It is written without objects to increase efficiency for if it is being used with a very large dataset.

Please refer to the issues tab to see future feature implementations as I have a few planned.

## Installation

For now, as this is still a work in progress, you can clone the repo and run **_main.py_** to run it. I will change this in future but for now it's too ~~bad~~ far from completion to make an installer or application.

## Credits

This project idea was taken from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/#command-line-project-ideas), but coded by me.
